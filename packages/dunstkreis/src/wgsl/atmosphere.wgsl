// these functions into their own shader. `@himmelszelt/dunstkreis` fills it via `atmosphereUniformData()`.
//
// Nothing here declares a binding: the struct is passed to every function by value instead. That keeps the
// snippet free of any assumption about group or binding indices, which is what makes it droppable into an
// existing pipeline. Declare the `var<uniform>` yourself, at whatever group and binding suit you.
//
// Scalars are packed into the tails of the vec3s, which WGSL's 16-byte vec3 alignment leaves free, giving
// a 96-byte block. `atmosphereUniformData()` writes exactly this layout and a test pins the two together.
