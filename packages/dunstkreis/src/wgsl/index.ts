/**
 * The WGSL layer, exported as plain strings so a consumer can compose these snippets into their own shader
 * instead of using this package's passes at all.
 *
 * The snippets are deliberately binding-free: `common` takes the `DkAtmosphere` struct from `atmosphere` by
 * value rather than reading a `var<uniform>`, so composing is concatenation plus declaring the binding yourself,
 * and nothing here can collide with your own group/binding indices.
 * Fill the uniform buffer with `atmosphereUniformData()`. Quality knobs are separate again: `quality` holds
 * WGSL `override` declarations, set at pipeline creation via `pipelineConstants()`, so that loop bounds stay
 * compile-time constants and an unused feature compiles out rather than branching.
 *
 * Every identifier is prefixed `dk` (or `DK_` for constants) so several `@himmelszelt/*` fragments can share one
 * shader module.
